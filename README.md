# hello-world
Getting to know Github. Next one's going to be more interesting. Check that out!

I love coding, though never had a chance to do much of it. I am here though and it's never going to be the same. 

Looking to have an 89.9 degree learning curve. Value to the fellow members guaranteed.

Also I am absolutely in love & good at writing my thoughts & ideas. Check me out on Medium to get into my mind. 
You'll love it there!!

Lastly always feel free to drop a message! Love helping and connecting with people. 

Look forward to connect! 

Cheers Mate.
