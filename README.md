# hello-world
Getting to know Github. Next one's going to be more interesting. Check that out!

I love coding, though never had a chance to do much there. I am here though and it's never going to be the same. 

Looking to have an 89.9 degree learning curve and provide value to the fellow community members in the process.

Also I absolutely love & am good at writing down my thoughts. So check me out on Medium to get in my mind. 
You'll absolutely love it there!!

Lastly always be free to drop a message! I love helping and connecting with people. 

Look forward to connect! Cheers Mate.
